This repository contains a comprehensive **hands-on manual** for OpenCV, authored by Layth Ayache. It accompanies the OpenCV Bootcamp and covers fundamental image I/O, pixel-level operations, classical computer-vision pipelines, and deep-learning workflowsâ€”all demonstrated with clear code examples and theory.
